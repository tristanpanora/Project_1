      <p> Parasite is a South Korean film, and happens to be
      the first ever foreign-language film to win best picture at the Oscars! It highlights
    class disparity and shows the lengths that some people are willing to go in order to not live
  in poverty. The main characters are a family that live in the slums of a South Korean city
they form a genius plan in order to get hired by a rich family for helping around the house.
Ultimately, things backfire, and they end up right back where they were. <br> I chose this
background because this location is Seoul, South Korea, and looks similar to the
area the family in the movie lived in. </p>
